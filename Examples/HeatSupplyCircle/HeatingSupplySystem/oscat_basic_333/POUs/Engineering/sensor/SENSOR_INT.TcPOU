this function calculates the real resistance of a sensor RX given a parasitic resistor in parallel to the sensor and an additional serial resistor.
for example a parasitic parallel resistor for a PT100 can be ignored but a series resistor is the cable to the sensor.
for a humidity sensor, the parallel resistor is more dramatic and needs to be considered.
the function allows to consider a parallel and serial resistor at the same time.
with this function and known parasitic serial and parallel resistors the true resistance of the sensor can be calculated.
