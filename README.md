# AixOCAT - Library framework for building automation systems based on the OSCAT libraries

[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](http://doge.mit-license.org)

AixOCAT is an open source community library framework for building automation systems and is based on the [OSCAT](http://www.oscat.de/) libraries.

As the library framework is developed at the [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute
for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1), the library's name AixOCAT is derived from the city's French 
name Aix-la-Chapelle, which the people of Aachen are very fond of and use a lot. 
With the name AixOCAT we follow this local tradition.

The full documentation of AixOCAT including examples and description of modules,
classes and functions can be found at the website:

This GitHub page will be used to further develop the package and make it
available under the
